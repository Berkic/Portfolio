          <p>Rich Skrenta is a computer programmer and entrepreneur known for his significant contribution to the field of computer security and web search. He is particularly well-known for creating the first-known computer virus, known as the "Elk Cloner," which was written for the Apple II computer in 1982 when he was just 15 years old. The Elk Cloner was a harmless virus that spread through infected floppy disks and displayed a playful poem on infected computers. It did not cause any serious harm, but it was one of the earliest instances of self-replicating computer code.</p>
